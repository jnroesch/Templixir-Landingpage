# Features That Make Email Collaboration Smoother

Templixir helps you preview, review, and share dynamic email templates without writing custom preview code or juggling endless test emails. Whether you’re a developer, marketer, or content stakeholder — Templixir keeps everyone aligned.

<hr>

### 🔍 Live Preview by User Segment

Switch between different user groups or data profiles to instantly see how the email changes. No need to write test scripts or render each version manually.

<hr>

### ⚙️ Smart Condition Logic

Use conditions like “if user is in group A” or “if data point X exists” to control what content appears. Templixir brings the logic into a clean, visual context that’s easy to manage.

<hr>

### 📤 Shareable Stakeholder Views

Send stakeholders a simple link where they can toggle conditions and see exactly what each recipient would receive. No screenshots, no code, no back-and-forth.

<hr>

### ✏️ Template Editing

Edit your email content directly in Templixir or import templates written in your preferred syntax (like Liquid, Handlebars, or custom tags). Designed for flexibility, not lock-in.

<hr>

### 🔄 Export-Ready HTML

Once you're happy with the result, export your dynamic template for use in your own system or email platform. You’re in control — we don’t send emails for you.

<hr>

### 🧪 Built for Review, Not Just Development

Templixir is lightweight and review-focused. It’s built to sit between your code and your stakeholders — so everyone stays in sync, and nothing gets lost in translation.
