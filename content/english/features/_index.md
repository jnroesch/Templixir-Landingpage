# Features That Make Email Collaboration Smoother

Templixir helps you preview, review, and share dynamic email templates without writing custom preview code or juggling endless test emails. Whether you’re a developer, marketer, or content stakeholder — Templixir keeps everyone aligned.

### 🔍 Live Preview by User Segment

Templixir lets you effortlessly preview how your email will appear to different types of users — whether they're in separate segments, regions, subscription tiers, or any custom group you define. Simply toggle between user profiles to see how the dynamic content adapts in real time.

No more sending test emails to yourself with modified payloads or writing custom rendering logic just to simulate a variation. With Templixir, the entire preview process is visual and immediate, so you can focus on getting the content right — not debugging conditions.

This feature is especially powerful for marketing teams, CRM managers, and product owners who need to validate personalized messaging across multiple scenarios. It brings clarity to complexity, and lets your entire team stay aligned without diving into code or running manual tests.

### ⚙️ Smart Condition Logic

Templixir gives you full control over what content appears in your email — and when — using intuitive, rule-based logic. Define conditions such as “if user is in group A,” “if the subscription is active,” or “if a custom flag is set,” and Templixir will automatically render the appropriate content blocks.

Unlike traditional email templates that require embedded logic or server-side code, Templixir presents these rules in a clean, visual format that’s easy to understand and update. Whether you're using simple flags or complex personalization rules, you can manage them all without digging into the codebase.

This makes it easy for both developers and non-technical collaborators to reason about who sees what and why — reducing errors, miscommunication, and guesswork. With Smart Condition Logic, personalization becomes a transparent, collaborative process, not a technical bottleneck.

### 📤 Shareable Stakeholder Views

Templixir makes it effortless to loop in stakeholders — without requiring them to understand code or navigate complicated tools. With just a single shareable link, you can give collaborators access to a live, interactive preview where they can toggle conditions and see exactly what each type of recipient will receive.

Instead of sending countless screenshots or trying to explain conditional logic in Slack threads or email chains, stakeholders can see the real email output for themselves. They can switch between user segments, review logic-driven variations, and confidently approve content knowing exactly what’s going out.

It eliminates the tedious back-and-forth, reduces confusion, and builds trust across teams. Whether it’s marketing leads, compliance reviewers, or client-facing stakeholders — everyone can stay aligned with a clear, hands-on view of the final result.

### ✏️ Template Editing

Templixir gives you the freedom to work with your email content the way you prefer — whether that’s editing directly in the interface or importing templates built with your favorite syntax like Liquid, Handlebars, or custom logic tags.

You can start from scratch, tweak existing layouts, or copy-paste your own markup — all within a fast, focused editing environment that was built for flexibility. The editor respects your formatting and logic structure while enhancing the workflow with live previews and condition-aware content blocks.

This means you're not locked into a proprietary templating system or forced to rewrite your logic. Developers can use the syntax they already trust, while marketers and content editors can still collaborate and preview without touching code. Templixir adapts to your process, instead of the other way around — making it easy to integrate with your existing tools, workflows, and delivery systems.

### 🔄 Export-Ready HTML

When your template is finalized and approved, Templixir makes it easy to export clean, production-ready HTML that works with your existing email delivery platform. Whether you're sending through a custom system, a marketing automation tool, or a transactional email service, you're free to plug the output wherever you need it.

Templixir isn’t another email service provider — we don’t send emails on your behalf (not yet, anyways). Instead, we focus on helping you build, preview, and approve dynamic templates with complete confidence. You stay in control of how and where your emails are delivered.

The exported HTML preserves your logic structure, is fully portable, and optimized for real-world rendering across clients. It’s a simple handoff from preview to production, without any surprises. This keeps your team agile and your workflows smooth — from first draft to final delivery.

### 🧪 Built for Review, Not Just Development

Templixir isn’t just another tool for developers — it’s a bridge between the people who build email templates and the people who need to understand and approve them. Designed with a lightweight, review-first mindset, Templixir helps ensure that everyone — from marketers to managers to developers — can stay aligned without extra overhead.

Rather than forcing stakeholders to dig through code or rely on devs for screenshots, Templixir gives them a clear, interactive way to review the actual output. It sits comfortably between your logic and your delivery system, acting as the source of truth during the approval process.

This helps teams catch issues earlier, reduce miscommunication, and deliver better emails faster. It’s the missing layer that turns email development from a siloed task into a shared, transparent workflow — where feedback is simple, and final sign-off feels easy.
