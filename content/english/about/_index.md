# Why we created Templixir

Templixir was born out of a simple frustration: previewing and validating dynamic email templates shouldnâ€™t be so hard.

If youâ€™ve ever worked on marketing campaigns, onboarding flows, or transactional emails with logic-based conditions â€” you know the pain. Screenshots for every variation, multiple test sends, and miscommunications with stakeholders who canâ€™t read template code.

Weâ€™ve been there too.

### Making Email Collaboration Effortless

Templixir is a web-based editor designed to make dynamic email collaboration seamless. It allows you to build personalized, logic-driven email templates that adapt to your audience â€” without the need for complex test setups or tedious review cycles.

You can write templates using flexible condition logic to control which content shows up for specific users or data scenarios. Then, easily preview how each variation will look by simulating different user segments, data states, or feature flags â€” all in real time.

Once you're happy with the results, you can generate a shareable preview link that allows non-technical stakeholders to explore and approve the template themselves. No more screenshots, no more misunderstandings â€” just clarity, speed, and alignment.

Templixir is built to bridge the gap between developers and collaborators. It empowers teams to work together on personalized email content with confidence and ease, from first draft to final sign-off.

### Our Vision

We believe great email content shouldnâ€™t be bottlenecked by technical friction. Templixir aims to streamline how teams collaborate on personalized communication â€” making it easier to visualize, review, and perfect your messaging.

Weâ€™re starting with email templates, but the goal is bigger: better workflows for conditional content across any medium.

Thanks for being part of this journey. ðŸš€
