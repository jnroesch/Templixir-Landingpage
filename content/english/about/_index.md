# Why we created Templixir

Templixir was born out of a simple frustration: previewing and validating dynamic email templates shouldnâ€™t be so hard.

If youâ€™ve ever worked on marketing campaigns, onboarding flows, or transactional emails with logic-based conditions â€” you know the pain. Screenshots for every variation, multiple test sends, and miscommunications with stakeholders who canâ€™t read template code.

Weâ€™ve been there too.

### Making Email Collaboration Effortless

Templixir is a web-based editor that lets you:
- Write your email templates using dynamic conditions
- Preview different variations by simulating user segments or data
- Share a live preview link with stakeholders â€” no code, no confusion

Itâ€™s built to bridge the gap between email developers and non-technical collaborators.

### Our Vision

We believe great email content shouldnâ€™t be bottlenecked by technical friction. Templixir aims to streamline how teams collaborate on personalized communication â€” making it easier to visualize, review, and perfect your messaging.

Weâ€™re starting with email templates, but the goal is bigger: better workflows for conditional content across any medium.

Thanks for being part of this journey. ðŸš€
